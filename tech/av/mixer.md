{% hint style="warning" %}
It is best practice to mute the respective channels prior to switching their phantom power supply on or off. Otherwise, the change of charge may cause an audible popping noise. Gain adjustments might also produce audible click noise when adjusted shortly after having switched phantom power on or off.
{% endhint %}

1. Preamp – Adjust the preamp gain for the selected channel with the Gain knob. Press the 48 V button to apply phantom power for use with condenser microphones and press the ø button to reverse the channel’s phase. The meter displays the selected channel’s level. Press the Low Cut button and select the desired high-pass frequency to remove unwanted lows. Press the View button to access more detailed parameters on the Main Display.

## General Usage

### **View buttons**

Throughout the top panel of the console, you will find small buttons labeled View. Press these buttons to immediately switch the console’s large color display (known as the Main Display) to show information related to the section whose View button you have just pressed. For example, if you are editing the equalizer and feel like seeing a large display of the EQ frequency response curve or corresponding EQ parameter value, simply press the adjacent View button in the EQ section. If you need to check where the monitor signal is being routed, simply press the View button next to the Phones Level knob and the main display will show the details. With the View button approach of the X32 PRODUCER console, there is almost never a need to drill down through multiple menu pages, since the View buttons will always take you directly to the relevant screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Setup/Global tab on the main display allows preferences for the behavior of View and Select buttons to be adjusted.
{% endhint %}

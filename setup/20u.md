# 20u Main Rack

The 20u main rack can be placed anywhere, so reference the [layout](week-zero-layout.md) to see where it will go. This rack should be set up first, as everything else will connect to it.



## Rack Layout

1. Router
2. Aggregation Switch
3. FMS Switch
4. Patch Panel
5. FMS Server
6. A/V Switch
7. Stream Encoder
8. A/V Compositor
9. Power Strip
10. Storage Drawer



## Setup

### Unpacking

1. Remove the front and back of the case and set aside
2. Place the case according to the [layout plan](week-zero-layout.md)
3. Lock the wheels in place so the case can't be pushed

### Power

1. Find the back side of the power strip. There is a cord that protrudes straight out the back of the power strip and is attached to the rear of the case. Plug this cord in.
2. Verify that everything in the rack powers on. The switches, router, and stream encoder will power on automatically. Everything else will be powered on in the next step.
3. Press the red power button on the FMS server and hold for about a second. You should hear the fans spin up, and then down again.
4. Press the power button on the compositor. The power light should turn on.

### Network

1. Find the rolled yellow ethernet cable in the back of the case. Unroll it and plug into any wall network port. The other end should already be plugged into the back of the patch panel.

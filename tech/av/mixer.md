1. Preamp – Adjust the preamp gain for the selected channel with the Gain knob. Press the 48 V button to apply phantom power for use with condenser microphones and press the ø button to reverse the channel’s phase. The meter displays the selected channel’s level. Press the Low Cut button and select the desired high-pass frequency to remove unwanted lows. Press the View button to access more detailed parameters on the Main Display. Note - It is best practice to mute the respective channels prior to switching their phantom power supply on or off. Otherwise, the change of charge may cause an audible popping noise. Gain adjustments might also produce audible click noise when adjust shortly after having switched phantom power on or off.

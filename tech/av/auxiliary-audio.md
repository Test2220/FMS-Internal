# Auxiliary Audio

## Pits Player

The Pit player is a Music player app that plays the FTC Continuous playlist.  It will only play on the Pit Feeds and will not interact with the Main Feed.

## Youtube Player

This Audio Player is for the Youtube feed and will feature a Playlist with Royalty Free music or music we can get a license for.  This is due to the actual Playlist in the arena having tons of issues with playing on Youtube due to licensing issues.  These issues could make VOD replay or even visibility impossible in specific regions.

## Audience Display

This plays back audio from cheesy arena for arena effects

# The Blue Alliance

The Blue Alliance is a site that contains every team and event in FIRST. Most teams will regularly look at TBA for info about the event and attending teams, so it's crucial that all info is up to date and accurate.

## Pre-Event Setup

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only one person should complete the pre-event setup to avoid duplicates, which can be difficult to resolve.
{% endhint %}

Whoever is responsible for pre-event setup will need a TBA account before completing any of the steps. Due to the time it takes to complete this process, it should be started at least 4 months in advance of the event.

### Step 1: Event Registration

[Go to the TBA offseason suggestion page](https://www.thebluealliance.com/suggest/offseason).

Fill out the form using the event details, but do NOT add a FIRST sync code, as our event does not have one. Event dates should be for all dates teams are in attendance, including Sunday. For team website, link directly to the week zero page, not the homepage.

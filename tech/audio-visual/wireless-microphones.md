1. Status Indicator - This LED displays the operation mode:
   1. GREEN: Normal Operation
   2. RED: Mute&#x20;
   3. Flashing GREEN: Low Battery&#x20;
2. Power/Mute Switch - Press and hold to turn the unit on or off. Press and release to mute or unmute the transmitter.
3. Battery Cover - Unscrew the battery cover and slide down to open the CH99 battery compartment.
4. Battery Holder - Open the battery holder by pressing the tab and lifting the cover. Insert two standard AA (LR6) batteries here, being sure to observe the plus and minus polarity markings shown. Although rechargeable NiCad and NiMH batteries can be used, they do not supply adequate current for more than four hours. WARNING: Do not insert the batteries backwards; doing so can cause severe damage to the CH99.
5. Input GAIN Control - This control adjusts the transmitter input sensitivity. For optimal performance, using the included screwdriver, set the input GAIN control to where you see the CR99 Audio Meter maximum indicator start to light under high levels, then turn down slowly until the maximum indicator stops lighting.&#x20;
6. IR Lens - This window is used to capture the infrared signal sent from the CR99 during the IR SET to channelize the transmitter. The battery cover must be open and the IR Lens facing towards the receiver to load the selected channel.
7. Plastic Screwdriver - Designed for use in adjusting the CB99 input GAIN control (See #5 Input GAIN Control HH).

1. Antenna Jacks - The rear BNC antenna jacks allow full rotation for optimum placement.\
   In normal operation, both antennas should be placed in a vertical position.
2. DC Input - Connect the supplied power adapter here, using the strain relief as shown in the illustration below. WARNING: Do not substitute any other kind of power adapter. Doing so can cause severe damage to the CR99.

1. BALANCED OUTPUT - Use this electronically balanced low impedance (600 Ohm) XLR jack when connecting the CR99 to professional (+4dBu) audio equipment. Pin wiring is as follows: Pin 1 ground, Pin 2 high (hot), and Pin 3 low (cold).
2. UNBALANCED OUTPUT - Use this unbalanced high impedance (5K Ohm) 1⁄4" jack\
   when connecting the CR99 to consumer (-10dBV) audio equipment. Wiring is as\
   follows: tip hot, sleeve ground.
